The folder contains two variants of the KATH algorithm from TKDE and two large data sets.
The algorithms embed each graph into the $l_1$ (hamming) space. 

If you use our algorithms and data sets in your research, please cite the following papers as reference in your publicaions:

Data:
Real-World data sets, nci-yeast-20K-balance and qHTS-20K-balance, are two large graph data sets in PubChem (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), both of which contain 10K positive instances and 10K negative ones.
