# graph_hashing
A toolbox of randomized hashing algorithms for fast Graph Representation and Network Embedding. We provide two sets of graph hashing algorithms as follows:

- Graph kernels for graph classification
    
    This problem provides a graph database which consists of multiple graphs, and contains the following steps:
    
    1. Each graph is represented as the hashcode;  
    2. Pairwise hamming similarity calculation between the hashcodes;  
    3. Hamming-similarity-based Graph classification.

- Network embedding for node classification, link prediction and node retrieval, etc.

    This task provides a network, and contains the following steps:
    
    1. Each node is represented as the hashcode;  
    2. Pairwise hamming similarity calculation between the hashcodes;  
    3. Hamming-similarity-based node classification, link prediction and node retrieval, etc.
